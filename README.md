# PartHound

**Find any part. Any yard. Every time.**

PartHound is a SaaS platform that aggregates salvage yard inventory across pick-and-pull and full-service junk yards into a single searchable catalog. Yards can also join the network and submit their own inventory directly.

Coming soon: a gig marketplace where verified pullers — mechanics and DIYers — can physically retrieve parts on behalf of buyers.

## What We're Building

### Phase 1 — Search & Catalog
- Scrape and normalize vehicle inventory from popular yards
- Onboard junk yards to self-manage their inventory listings
- Unified search across all participating yards by year, make, model

### Phase 2 — Gig Marketplace
- Unified search across all participating yards by part (in addition to vehicle)
- Buyers submit pull requests for specific parts
- Verified pullers ("Hounds") claim and fulfill requests if the participating yard is a pick-and-pull
- Verified courriers fulfill requests from participating yards who pick their own part (iventory management in the yard dashboard to ensure availability)
- In-app communication, photo verification, and payment processing

### Phase 3 — Expansion
- Nationwide yard coverage
- Puller ratings, specialties, and tiered verification
- Yard analytics and demand insights
- API access for third-party integrations
